# SHA256-cracker

I wrote this solution to learn Python's syntax. Cracking passwords without owner's consent is illegal, also if you crack after take consent and you can't prove it that you got it then you may be in trouble.

Recommendations:
1. Don't attempt to crack SHA hashes that don't belong to you.
2. Don't use code from categories such as hacks, cracks, etc. if you don't understand what it does.
3. Don't attempt to hack any systems unless you have the necessary authorization or contractual agreement for penetration testing.


You can have good intentions but other people don't know it.
